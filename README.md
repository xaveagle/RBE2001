SimplePacketComs

EspWii

WiiChuck

# Set up your project

## Create your private repository (Once per term per team)

In the browser, click the "+" button next to your user Icon in the upper right corner of any github page. 

Select Import repository. 

Use the URL:
```
https://github.com/WPIRoboticsEngineering/RBE2001_template
```

BE SURE TO SELECT PRIVATE! 

Set the name during the import step as "RBE2001". **Do Not put anything different from that exact string**, Arduino uses directory names to find header files, and this project needs the name to be exactly "RBE2001". Change only if you and your team have all had experience with Arduino Library develoment.  

## Add your team mates as collaborators

In your new repository, under 
```
Settings -> Collaborators
```
Search and add your team mates. 

# Develop Code for your project

## Install Eclipse and the Sloeber plugin (If the computer doesn't already have it)

Download the eclipse installer from here:

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Open the installer, select the C developemt version and install it. 

Once the install is done, open eclipse and go to the workbench. Open
```
Help->Eclipse Marketplace...
```
Search for Sloeber 

Install "The Arduino Eclipse IDE named Sloeber" and restart eclipse. 

If you are using Windows you may get an error regarding paths being longer than 40 characters. Click Ok

Set the workspace to Arduino mode by cicking the Arduino button in the top right hand corner next to quick access or by opening perspective and selecting Arduino

Open the Arduino Preferences:
```
Arduino -> Preferences
```

Under toolchains, select New.. and search for (where you extracted Arduino)/hardware/ 

Mine looks like:
```
/opt/arduino-1.8.1/hardware/
```

Under Private Library path, select New.. and search for your user library directory. It is usually in (your users home)\Documents\Arduino\libraries for Windows, or (your users home)/Arduino/libraries for Unix systems. You know you have the right one if the folder contains ESP32Servo, Esp32SimplePacketComs, SimplePacketComs, EspWii and WiiChuck Directories from the library install step above. Remember the location of this folder, it will be where you clone your code in a coming step. 

Mine looks like:
```
/home/hephaestus/Arduino/libraries/
```

## Clone your project

In eclipse, open 
```
Window->Show View-> Other -> Git ->Git Repositories
```

In the browser, Click the clone or download button in your new project and select clone (Be sure HTTPS not SSH is selected, unless you have set up your SSH keys). 

Copy the clone URL.

In Eclipse, right click in the git repositories and select clone. If your URL is still copied in the clip board, Eclipse will autofill most the clone information for the first step. Add your username and password.

Hit next and get to the Branch Selection window, change nothing and hit next.

Set the Destination Directory to your Arduino libraries folder (the folder you are still remembering from above). It is usually in (your users home)\Documents\Arduino\libraries for Windows, or (your users home)/Arduino/libraries for Unix systems. 

Mine looks like:
```
/home/hephaestus/Arduino/libraries/RBE2001
```

Hit Finish

## Open your project and start working

To open the project you will be using Sloeber and the "Linked Example" development model. Your code is set up as a library. your launch file is the .ino, which is found in your projects "examples" directory. 

In Eclipse, Right click in the Project View and select 
```
New->Arduino Sketch
```
Give it a name, and select the ESP32 toolchain. 
```
Board: ESP32 Dev Module
Upload Protocol: Default
Port (the port your device is on)
Core Debug Level: None
Flash Frequency 80mhz
Flash Mode: QIO
Flash Size: 4mb
Upload Speed: 921600
```
Then hit next

Select Sample sketch in the "Select Code:" dropdown. Select "Link to selected examples" and check the check box for
```
RBE2001 examples ->Final Project
```
Hit finish. The code that you should edit is in your project under libraries/RBE2001/



# Commit your changes

When you make a change to any line of code, you should commit your changes. If you have worked for ~1 hour, then you should make a commit with a message describing your work. To do so, go back to 

Git Repositories

Expand it and right click on Working Tree and select Add to Index. This loads your changes into the git module.

Finally right click on RBE2001[master]->Commit

Be sure to set the "Author" and "Committer" fields sould both contain the same data like this:
```
Kevin Harrington <harrington@wpi.edu>
```

Messages should consist of 60 charrectors of short description describing what changed, 2 new lines, then a t least one full sentance describing the justification for the change. If you have more than one fime, only commit one at a time. using the "+" and "-" buttons in the Git Staging section. 

When you have chages to share with your team, first Right click on the repository and select "Pull". Merge any changes your team mates made and published to upstream. Then commit the merge (or commit nothing if the merge was clean) and push your changes to the upstream server.

Once you have pushed your changes, be sure to verify that they are on GitHub. On your repository, go to
```
Insights->Network
```
and verify your changes are there. 


# 2001 Final Project Commands

### E-Stop 

| |ID | byte |
|--- |--- | --- |
| downstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents downstream |1989 | --- |
| upstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents upstream |1989 | ---|

Set an E-Stop fault on the robot. No data is transmitted, but the state of the robot should be effected. The robot should freeze all motor functions within a 10ms of receiving this command. 

### Get Status
| |ID | byte |
|--- |--- | --- |
| downstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents downstream |2012 | --- |
| upstream Bytes |4 | 1 |
| Contents upstream |2012 | status value|

Request the status of the robot. The byte value represents the robot state.

| State description | value |

|--- |--- | --- |
| downstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents downstream |1871 | --- |
| upstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents upstream |1871 | ---|

Clear all faults on the robot. No data is transmitted, but the state of the robot should be effected. The robot should bring it's self online. 

### Pick Order

| |ID | float |float |float |
|--- |--- | --- |--- | --- |
| downstream Bytes |4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| Contents downstream |1936 | pickup material | dropoff angle | dropoff position | 
| upstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents upstream |1936 | ---|

| Material Type | value |
|--- |--- |
| Aluminum | 0 |
| Plastic | 1 |


An order is placed with the robot. The first 3 values are the pickup material, followed by the drop off angle and the drop off position.

### Get Location 
| |ID | float |float |float |float |float |float |float |float |
|--- |--- | --- |--- | --- |--- | --- | --- |--- | --- | 
| downstream Bytes |4 | 0 |
| Contents downstream |1994 | --- |

| Contents upstream |1994 | X Location | Y Location | Z Location | azimuth | elevation | tilt | bounding cylinder radius | bounding cylinder height | 

Request for the position and orentation of the robot. Location is in MM from the loading point in location 0 to the center bottom of the bounding cylinder of the robot. The size of the robot is reported in MM measured in positive values from center bottom of the bounding cylinder that envelops the robot. The center is defined as the turning center of the robot. The radius is the distance to the furthest point on the robot from the turning center. Maximum radius is 100mm. Direction of travil is +X in the robots coordinate frame.

### Direct Drive
| |ID | float |float |float |float |float |float |float |float |
|--- |--- | --- |--- | --- |--- | --- | --- |--- |--- |
| downstream Bytes |4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |4 |4 |
| Contents downstream |1786  | delta X Location | delta Y Location |delta  Z Location | delta azimuth | delta elevation | delta tilt | # Miliseconds this update should take | Session ID|
| upstream Bytes |4 | 4 |
| Contents upstream |1786  | value from 0-1 to indicate progress on current session  |

This is a command to drive a robot directly. The values represent a relative motion from current location. +X is forward for the robot.Angle values are in degrees and translation values are in Milimeters.  Azimuth values range from -180 to 180 with 0 along the robots X dimention. Elevation values are rotation values from -90 to 90 about the Y dimention with 0 being along the x dimenttion. Tilt values are rotations from -180 to 180 about the X dimention with 0 being aligned with the X-Y plane. 

The session ID is a random integer from 0 - 100000 indicating the current drive command. It will change when the target is updateted. It is used to differentiate between new commands. 

The command should return the current progress on the current command ID.
